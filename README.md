Bicycle is a 58 key ortholinear split keyboard PCB with a 5 key thumb cluster.

A more ergonomic version of the Let's Split keyboard, it adds an additional row to the matrix for use by a 30 degree angled thumb cluster of keys. Designed to be easy to build, it only supports serial communication over a TRRS cable and no LED support. The PCB is reversible, meaning that you need two of the same PCB to create a full keyboard.
